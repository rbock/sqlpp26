# Differences between sqlpp23 and sqlpp26

Dropped naming style option for code generator. Names are used as-is
SQLPP_CREATE_NAME_TAG
.as

`_alias` literal

Dropped schema-qualified tables (or rather, the idea is to make the schema part of the table name)
Reflection:
  - table definition
  - type_set
  - type_vector
  - result_set definition

expressions closer to c++, e.g. int + uint -> uint
char is considered arithmetic, not text

nullopt is not compatible with all data types. e.g. concat(std::nullopt) is incorrect now. foo.id == std::nullopt is also not OK.

constexpr:
  - flat_set -> type_set
  - exception (instead of wrapped static assert)

C++26 features

- Reflection
- constexpr flat_set
- constexpr vector
- constexor exception
- pack indexing
- structured binding pack
- consteval blocks
- template for

Currently still waiting for

- structural std::string_view


error quality:
at least one having-expression statically requires a table which is only known dynamically in the statement' != 'The having-clause statically requires table tab_bar which is only known dynamically in the statement'

insert: required column 'bool_nn' is missing

Other changes:
Using C++ type instead of placeholders. This changes APIs a bit, e.g. 

cast(sqlpp::integral) -> sqlpp::cast<int64_t>()
